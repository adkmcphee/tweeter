# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simplified, single-page Twitter clone.

I built this application as a way to practice my HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, as well as my Node and Express back-end skills.

The application allows for users to draft and send tweets which will be reloaded automatically on the page, displaying a randomly generated username, avatar, Tweeter handle, and time since the tweet has been sent. 

To use the application, make surre you have the dependencies downloaded (using the `npm install` command), start the web server using the `npm run local` command, and visit the application at <http://localhost:8080/>.

You can see snippets of the application in the screenshots below.
